    <p>My recent hang gliding experience with Harry and Harriet’s Hang-gliding Haven was somewhat mixed. While the instructors were friendly, I felt the overall professionalism was lacking compared to other companies I've tried. The location was decent, but nothing particularly spectacular. Additionally, while the equipment was functional, it seemed a bit dated. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I may explore other options next time.</p>
